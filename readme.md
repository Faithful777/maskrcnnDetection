**Tutorial: Finetuning Mask R-CNN for Object Detection and Instance Segmentation on a Custom Dataset**

This tutorial shows how to finetune a pre-trained Mask R-CNN model on the Penn-Fudan Database for Pedestrian Detection and Segmentation using the new features in torchvision.

**Defining the Dataset**

Your dataset should inherit from the `torch.utils.data.Dataset` class and implement the `__len__` and `__getitem__` methods. The `__getitem__` method should return a tuple containing the following:

* `image`: A `torchvision.tv_tensors.Image` of shape `[3, H, W]`, a pure tensor, or a PIL Image of size `(H, W)`.
* `target`: A dictionary containing the following fields:
    * `boxes`: A `torchvision.tv_tensors.BoundingBoxes` of shape `[N, 4]`, containing the coordinates of the `N` bounding boxes in `[x0, y0, x1, y1]` format, ranging from `0` to `W` and `0` to `H`.
    * `labels`: An integer `torch.Tensor` of shape `[N]`, containing the label for each bounding box. `0` represents the background class.
    * `image_id`: An integer identifier for the image. It should be unique between all the images in the dataset and is used during evaluation.
    * `area`: A float `torch.Tensor` of shape `[N]`, containing the area of the bounding box. This is used during evaluation with the COCO metric to separate the metric scores between small, medium, and large boxes.
    * `iscrowd`: A `uint8` `torch.Tensor` of shape `[N]`. Instances with `iscrowd=True` will be ignored during evaluation.
    * (optionally) `masks`: A `torchvision.tv_tensors.Mask` of shape `[N, H, W]`, containing the segmentation masks for each one of the objects.

**Finetuning the Model**

Once you have defined your dataset, you can finetune the Mask R-CNN model using the following steps:

1. Load a pre-trained Mask R-CNN model.
2. Update the number of classes in the model to match the number of classes in your dataset.
3. Create a `torch.optim.Optimizer` object to train the model.
4. Define a loss function.
5. Start the training loop:
    * Forward pass the image through the model to get the predictions.
    * Calculate the loss.
    * Backward pass the loss to update the model parameters.

**Evaluating the Model**

Once the model is trained, you can evaluate it on your dataset using the following steps:

1. Load the trained model.
2. Iterate over the test set:
    * Forward pass the image through the model to get the predictions.
    * Calculate the evaluation metrics.

**Conclusion**

This tutorial has shown how to finetune a pre-trained Mask R-CNN model on a custom dataset using the new features in torchvision.
